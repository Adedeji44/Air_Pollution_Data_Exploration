## Air_Pollution_Data_Exploration - Dimentionality Reduction - PCA and t-SNE

Air pollution is all around us. The rise in permissible concentrations of various pollutants observed over the last few decades contributes to rising pollution levels. As a result, affecting the weather conditions in an unfavorable manner and the formation of smog phenomena. In fact, the affected air quality level in the atmosphere has a negative impact on individual health and may cause an economic imbalance. Diseases caused by rising pollution levels are one of the major issues confronting urban settlements

**Objective :** 

**- Explore and visualize the Air Pollution dataset, which contains information about air molecules and pollutants found in the air**

**- Reduce the number of features by using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE, and extract insights about the data.**
